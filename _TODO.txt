make 4k volumes

Tracer Features:
- store vel max per brick
- Periodic tracing?
- CatRom in time?
- Tracing progress
- inconsistent results: disk wait bailout -> budget reset
- Interpolated (dense) output also for other integrators?
- Flow graph

Tracer Efficiency:
- loading: separate thread?
- don't shift time slots around (ringbuffer!)
- start threads only for active lines?
- sort checkpoints by locality?
- cudaCompress: multiBlock DWT?
- cudaCompress: put quantMap into cudaArray
- cudaCompress: merge small cudaMemcpys
- BuildIndexBuffer?

flow graph: always round up?

line normals: store as scalar?
simple lines (pos+time only)


Renderer:
fix near plane clipping
timing: track I/O waiting time
per-brick timings: optionally only for full bricks
clip plane
non-compressed: parallel upload+render?
Preintegration
MIDA kernel? tf importance channel?
float render target?
Stereo: per-eye brick sorting
filtering: optimize x kernel, proper boundaries (wrap)
render modes: DVR + Iso/SIVR? Two-sided iso?
precomputed measure volume: automatically choose quant step

Multi-GPU:
fix tracing + multi-GPU rendering
multi-GPU images not equal to single-GPU?
multi-GPU filtering

Compress:
streams? (-> cudpp)
